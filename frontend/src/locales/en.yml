      intro: Welcome to the FairGame-Tutorial!
    goal1:
      title: Goal
      intro: The game is separated into Ladders, the goal of each Ladder is to reach the top and promote to the next one.
    goal2:
      title: Goal
      intro: The goal of the game is to reach the highest ladder in a round and promote before the game resets.
    points:
      title: Points
      intro: Points define your Rank. \n\n You need to reach the most points to promote to the next Ladder.
    power:
      title: Power
      intro: Power defines how many points you get each Second. \n\n The lower you are on the ladder, the more power/s you get.
    bias:
      title: Bias
      intro: You can use Bias to gain a flat increase in power/s. This upgrade resets your points back to 0.
    multi:
      title: Multi
      intro: Multi can be used to increase your power/s multiplicatively. This upgrade resets not only your points, but also your power.
    vinegar:
      title: Vinegar
      intro: Vinegar is used to throw at active Ranker at the top of you Ladder. \n\n If you have more than them they get thrown down to the bottom of your Ladder. \n\n If not, then they lose the amount of vinegar that you threw and they stay at the top.
    grapes:
      title: Grapes
      intro: Grapes define how much vinegar/s you get. \n\n You gain 2 Grapes for every second at the bottom of the Ladder and 1 Grape for every Ranker that passes you (if you are at x2 or above). \n\n You can also buy Autopromote with Grapes (cheapest at the bottom).
